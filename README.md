# Deep-Learning-Techniques-for-Ship-Classification-A-Comparative-Analysis:

This project focuses on classifying five distinct ship types from a dataset using three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures: the base model, VGG16, and DenseNet121. 
The dataset comprises approximately 7,000 images categorized into Cargo, Military, Carrier, Cruise, and Tankers.

Different preprocessing techniques were applied, including train-test splitting, image resizing, and normalization to enhance model accuracy. 
After evaluation, DenseNet121 emerged as the top-performing model based on validation accuracy, outperforming VGG16 and the base model.
